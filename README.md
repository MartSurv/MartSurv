# Hi there 👋 my name is Martynas!

I enjoy creating static websites, dynamic web apps, sharing my knowledge, learning new things, solving problems, and embracing the challenges that each project brings. My goal is to build modern, fast, and responsive websites that are easy to use and provide a pixel-perfect, performant experience.

Beyond technical expertise, I'm passionate about mentoring and motivating people who want to learn web development. I believe in empowering others to join this exciting learning journey and I am dedicated to helping them unlock their full potential.

My daily tools:

- **Front-End:** HTML | CSS (SASS) | JavaScript (TypeScript, React.js, Next.js)
- **Back-End:** Node.js | GraphQL
- **Other Tools:** npm | yarn | git | webpack | vite | eslint | stylelint | prettier | Jest | React Testing Library | Contentful | Heroku | Netlify and more...
- **UI Libraries That I Worked With:** Ant Design | PrimeReact | MUI | Mantine | Semantic UI | Bootstrap | Kendo UI
